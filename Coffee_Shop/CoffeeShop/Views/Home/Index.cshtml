                Les Deux Magots is a famous café in the Saint-Germain-des-Prés area of Paris,
                France. It once had a reputation as the rendezvous of the
                literary and intellectual élite of the city. It is now a popular tourist destination. Its historical
                reputation is derived from the patronage of Surrealist artists, intellectuals such as Simone de
                Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre, and young writers, such as Ernest Hemingway. Other patrons
                included Albert Camus, Pablo Picasso, James Joyce, Bertolt Brecht, Julia Child, and the American
                writers James Baldwin, Chester Himes and Richard Wright.<br><br> The Deux Magots literary prize has been
                awarded to a French novel every year since 1933.

                "Magot" literally means "stocky figurine from the Far East". The name originally
                belonged to a fabric and novelty shop at nearby 23 Rue de Buci. The shop sold silk lingerie and took
                its name from a popular play of the moment (1800s) entitled Les Deux Magots de la Chine. Its two
                statues represent Chinese "mandarins", or "magicians" (and "alchemists", depending upon one's
                philosophical point of view), who gaze serenely over the room. In 1873, the business moved to its
                current location in the Place Saint-Germain-des-Prés. In 1884, the business changed to a café and
                liquoriste, keeping the name.<br><br>
                Auguste Boulay bought the business in 1914, when it was on the brink of bankruptcy, for 400,000
                francs. The present manager, Catherine Mathivat, is his great-great-granddaughter.
